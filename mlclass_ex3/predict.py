    # ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
    # Instructions: Complete the following code to make predictions using
    #               your learned neural network. You should set p to a
    #               vector containing labels between 1 to num_labels.
    #
    # Hint: The argmax function might come in useful. In particular, the argmax
    #       function returns the index of the max element, for more information
    #       see 'help(argmax)'. If your examples are in rows, then, you can
    #       use argmax(A, 1) to obtain the max for each row.
